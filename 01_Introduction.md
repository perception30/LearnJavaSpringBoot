## 3: Setting Up the Development Environment

Setting up a robust development environment is crucial for efficient and effective development. This section guides you through configuring your system for Java and Spring Boot development.

### Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)

1. **Download JDK**:
   - Navigate to the [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) page.
   - Alternatively, use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) for an open-source version.

2. **Installation Steps**:
   - **Windows**:
     - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
     - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the JDK installation directory.
     - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the `PATH` variable.
   - **macOS**:
     - Use Homebrew: `brew install openjdk@11`
     - Update your shell profile:
       ```bash
       export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11
       export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
       ```
   - **Linux**:
     - Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., for Ubuntu:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
       ```
     - Verify installation:
       ```bash
       java -version
       ```

### Setting Up an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse)

Choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) enhances productivity. Here's how to set up two popular IDEs:

#### IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Download and Install**:
   - Visit the [IntelliJ IDEA Downloads](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) page.
   - Choose between the Community Edition (free) or Ultimate Edition (paid).

   - Install necessary plugins, such as Spring Boot and Lombok support.
   - Configure the JDK in `File > Project Structure > SDKs`.

3. **Create a New Project**:
   - Select `Spring Initializr` to bootstrap your Spring Boot project directly from the IDE.

#### Eclipse

1. **Download and Install**:
   - Visit the [Eclipse Downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) page and download the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Install the Spring Tools Suite (STS) plugin for enhanced Spring Boot support via `Help > Eclipse Marketplace`.

3. **Create a New Project**:
   - Use the `Spring Starter Project` wizard to initialize your project with Spring Boot dependencies.

### Installing Maven or Gradle

Build automation tools like Maven and Gradle manage project dependencies and build processes.

#### Maven

1. **Download Maven**:
   - Visit the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) website and download the binary archive.

2. **Installation**:
   - Extract the archive to a desired location, e.g., `/opt/maven`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export MAVEN_HOME=/opt/maven
   export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   mvn -v
   ```

#### Gradle

1. **Download Gradle**:
   - Visit the [Gradle Releases](https://gradle.org/releases/) page and download the latest binary.

2. **Installation**:
   - Extract the archive to `/opt/gradle`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle
   export PATH=$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   gradle -v
   ```

### Configuring Version Control with Git

Version control is essential for tracking changes and collaborating with others.

1. **Install Git**:
   - **Windows**: Download from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - **macOS**: Use Homebrew: `brew install git`.
   - **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install git` for Ubuntu.

2. **Configure Git**:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Initializing a Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Creating a `.gitignore` File**:
   ```gitignore
   /build/
   /target/
   *.log
   *.class
   .idea/
   .DS_Store
   ```

5. **Basic Git Commands**:
   - **Add Files**: `git add .`
   - **Commit Changes**: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
   - **Push to Remote**:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
     git push -u origin master
     ```
